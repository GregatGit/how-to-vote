# The Iron Throne

## Who should rule the 7 or 6 Kingdoms?

For many it was a tough ending.

This won&#39;t make it better, but it might help.

An app that lets you choose who should sit on the iron throne.

Built with

- React
- Redux
- Semantic-UI

And bootstrapped with create-react-app.

It still is far from finished but you can see where it&#39;s headed.

The app is up and running but the stylings are very basic and experimental. 
I would also like to add other features to make it fun to share and compare.
